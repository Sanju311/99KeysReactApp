# 99KeysReactApp


Hello Hiring Managers,

I've developed this simple react app for the full stack exam. It allows the user to upload an image and crop it through means of zooming and rotation. The user can then save there edits and the modified
image is displayed. There also is a form for the user to fill out with details regarding the floor plan. Currently nothing is done with the edited image and inputted data besides being shown back to the user
as the challenge did not specify anything. Attached below is also a visual demo of the app in case there are issues cloning it. I look forward to hearing back for the interview! - Sanju S.
